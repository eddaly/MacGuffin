Multi coded readers. Specifics involve lack of 6 USB inputs on the Pi, a USB hub?
Getting device by UUID, should work, but subject to USB ordering.
Use of bit code over single wire, subject to some recognition delay.

A pulse length code would be about the only option with current board design.

00000000000000000000000000000 ........... No card
11111111111111111111111111111 ........... Correct Card
01010101010101010101010101010 ........... Wrong Card

A filter of the GPIO input value would tend to 0, 0.5, or 1.

There should be some slice ranges, such that "ding, dong" sound hunting is not a problem.
There should be some valid in time windowing to prevent "ding, dong" Wrong card when floating to correct card.

There should not be too much problem in this as a full lay would be the optimum point to dwell and then "ding."

Maybe better to use USB hub and add prefix to duino outputs based on position.

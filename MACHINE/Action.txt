Found library for Pi reading of basic ID information.

Created initial commit from RADIO. Lots to delete. No GUI, basic boot rc.local.
The RFID has bee programmed as number 6. (needed?) --- NOPE the Pi is the RFID master.

DUINO PINS
==========
A0 -> RES to 5V and MID socket, MID socket other to GND (=> MID socket is POT to GND?)
D2 -> BCM 18 PWM0 (current duino flashed is output) WARN!!! Pi set as input on boot so ok for now)

OTHER (lower) 2 PIN socket is POWER to DUINO

8 PIN (upper)
=============
1 -> 3V3 (left most, key top)
2 -> (pin 22) BCM 25
3 -> (pin 9) GND
4 -> VOID
5 -> (pin 21) BCM 9 (MISO)
6 -> (pin 19) BCM 10 (MOSI)
7 -> (pin 23) BCM 11 (SCLK)
8 -> (pin 24) BCM 8 (CE0) -> Technically SDA on RFID reader

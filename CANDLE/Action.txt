Setting thse 4 pis to autoboot.
When tags are programmed, alter the number in the_key,
Each pi has a unique piID variable equal to 1, 2, 3 or 4.
the_key is set to all [1, 1, 1, 1] for testing.
BUILD = False must be set on each on install to use the show controller.

The following 2 commands were run

sudo apt-get install python-dev python-pip

sudo pip install pyserial

An rc.local line was created for auto boot.
========================================================================
Created repo from machine copy
A simple script so that all pis can run same code.
The following pins make the pi behave as:

# a set up pins. pull one up to indicate which candle is being
IS_21 = 8 # pin 12
IS_22 = 9 # pin 18
IS_23 = 10 # pin 16
IS_24 = 11 # pin 32

#this may get changed later

DON' FORGET TO CHANGE BUILD = False in production.
piID is pi number 0 to 3 based.
all of them can handle chest. "open" from show controller.

Installed Pi bakery (to test building an image), as git is not a default to pull, for install.sh
It looks a bit like scratch for building some defaults, and automation of networking setup
and package downloads. 

Must pull to a pi th chmod the scripts, and then push? Windows is a bit lax in this way.

The network is recommended to be a 2 step process. An automated pull to a local repository
on a pi designed for distibution. The an email sent to the admin that there is a pullable.
Then an automated pull then onto the machines. This has the advantage of an easy hold
and also no problems with a live update during a game.

CONS: It is more difficult to implement. I'm not sure what the current firewall status is
and it maybe better to only update while on site, or make the proxy on site, do an automated
ssh into the games to do the pull that way from a script on the "local" repo.
